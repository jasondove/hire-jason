				`Agile development is the gold standardâ€”but different methodologies are appropriate for different teams.
					Scrum is great for planning ahead, but can be time-consuming and inflexible. Kanban streamlines
					the workflow, but can be vulnerable to feature creep. As in development, it's important to pick the
					right tool for the job.`,
				`Nobody likes surprises. If someone on my team isn't meeting expectations it's my responsibility to work
				 	to get them up to speed. If a deadline is going to slip it's best to bring it up sooner rather than 
				 	later.`,
				`Praise publicly and criticize privately. A rising tide lifts all boats, and a petty manager bums out
					the whole team.`,
				`People first! In my experience if people are happy and motivated everything else follows naturally. Are
					people happy at your company? If so, I'd like to join you. Let's set up an interview and find out
					if we'd work well together.`

				some core principles have withstood the test of time:`,
			list: [
				`Strive to write reusable, self-documenting code. If a junior dev can't read and use my code five years
					from now I've got some cleanup to do.`,
				`Responsive design is a must. The future of the web is on devices, and a company ignores that
					at their own peril.`,
				`Don't be afraid to embrace new technologies, but also don't spend too much time chasing after the
